## Spotted Lanternfly Presence During Mechanical Harvesting

**Team:** Tree of Hell  
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E&J Gallo Winery / National Grape

---

## Problem Statement

During mechanical harvesting in upstate New York vineyards, Spotted Lanternflies (SLF) contaminate harvested grapes. Because grapes are partially liquified during mechanical harvesting and product quality standards are strict, simple filtering methods are ineffective.

---

## Impact

This project introduces a modular in-line attachment that:

- Reduces contaminated yield  
- Preserves usable grape juice  
- Maintains harvest efficiency  
- Minimizes modification to existing equipment  

---

## Proposed Direction

1. Separate juice from the grape–SLF mixture  
2. Filter SLFs from grapes  
3. Filter the extracted juice  
4. Recombine grapes and juice before final collection  

---

## Primary Concept

A pressurized water tunnel system using:

- Controlled water flow separation  
- OR centrifugal force separation  

Filtration stages:
- Juice filtration  
- SLF removal  
- Controlled recombination
