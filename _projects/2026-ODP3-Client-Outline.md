# Spotted Lanternfly Separation System

In February 2026, as part of ODP 3, our team developed a client-driven engineering concept to address contamination of mechanically harvested grapes by Spotted Lanternflies (SLF) in upstate New York vineyards.

---

## The Problem

During mechanical harvesting, grapes become partially liquified before collection. If Spotted Lanternflies are present in the vines, they enter the harvested mixture and contaminate the product.

Because:

- grapes are partially crushed during harvest,  
- product quality standards are strict, and  
- contamination leads to rejected batches,  

simple filtering solutions are ineffective.

This results in wasted product, increased processing costs, and operational inefficiencies.

---

## System Objective

The goal of this project was to design a modular in-line attachment that:

- prevents SLFs from entering final collection bins,  
- preserves usable grape juice,  
- maintains harvest throughput,  
- integrates with existing mechanical harvesters.  

---

# Proposed Separation Process

The system intercepts the grape–SLF mixture before final collection and performs staged separation:

1. Separate juice from the grape–SLF mixture  
2. Filter SLFs from the grape solids  
3. Filter and recover extracted juice  
4. Recombine grapes and juice prior to final collection  

This preserves product integrity while eliminating insect contamination.

# Primary Concept

## Pressurized Water Tunnel System

The proposed mechanism uses fluid dynamics and mechanical separation to isolate insects from product flow.

Two potential separation approaches were explored:

- Controlled water-flow separation  
- Centrifugal force separation  

Filtration stages include:

- juice filtration,  
- SLF removal,  
- controlled recombination of product streams.

# Engineering Considerations

Key design constraints included:

- compatibility with common harvester models in upstate NY,  
- modular installation without permanent modification,  
- maintaining required collection throughput,  
- preventing clogging or buildup during filtration.  

Grower usability and maintenance requirements were also considered during concept development.

---

# Key Risks

- Interference with harvester functionality  
- Throughput mismatch causing backup  
- Grower reluctance to adopt new technology  
- Additional maintenance burden  

These risks informed the modular and serviceable design direction.

# Summary

This project addressed a real agricultural systems problem using mechanical design and fluid separation principles. The proposed solution introduces a staged in-line filtration mechanism that removes insect contamination while preserving grape juice and maintaining operational efficiency.

The concept demonstrates how systems-level mechanical design can improve agricultural productivity while minimizing disruption to existing equipment.
