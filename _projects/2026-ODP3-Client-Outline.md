## ODP 3 – Spotted Lanternfly Separation System

**Team:** Tree of Hell  
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E&J Gallo Winery / National Grape

---

## Problem Statement

During mechanical harvesting in upstate New York vineyards, Spotted Lanternflies (SLF) contaminate harvested grapes. Because grapes are partially liquified during mechanical harvesting and product quality standards are strict, simple filtering methods are ineffective.

Contamination results in wasted product and increased processing costs.

---

## Proposed Solution

A modular in-line separation system inserted between the harvester and the collection bin that:

1. Separates juice from the grape–SLF mixture  
2. Filters SLFs from grapes  
3. Filters extracted juice  
4. Recombines grapes and juice before final collection  

This preserves product integrity while eliminating contamination.

## Primary Concept

A pressurized water tunnel system using either:

- Controlled water flow separation  
- Centrifugal force separation  

Filtration stages:
- Juice filtration  
- SLF removal  
- Controlled recombination
