## Spotted Lanternfly Presence During Mechanical Harvesting

**Team:** Tree of Hell  
**Client(s):** Cornell CALS Extension / E&J Gallo Winery / National Grape

---

## Problem Statement

During mechanical harvesting in upstate New York vineyards, **Spotted Lanternflies (SLF)** contaminate harvested grapes. Because grapes are partially liquified during the mechanical harvesting process and product quality standards are high, trivial separation methods are ineffective.

Contamination leads to wasted product, additional labor, and reduced processing efficiency.

---

## Impact

This project targets a single modular insertion point within the harvesting process.  

The solution is designed to:

- Reduce contaminated yield
- Preserve usable grape juice
- Improve harvest efficiency
- Minimize modifications to existing harvesting systems
- Maintain compatibility with standard vineyard equipment

---

## Proposed Direction

Before final collection:

1. Separate juice from the grape–SLF mixture  
2. Filter SLFs from grapes  
3. Filter the extracted juice  
4. Recombine grapes and juice before final collection  

This maintains product integrity while eliminating contamination.

---

## Primary Concept

### What It Is

A pressurized water tunnel system that separates grapes and SLFs using either:

- Controlled water-pressure flow separation  
- OR centrifugal force separation  

Filtration occurs in stages:

- Juice filtration
- SLF removal
- Controlled recombination of grapes and juice

---

### How It Would Be Used

The apparatus would be installed **in-line between the harvester and collection system** as a modular attachment.  

The design prioritizes minimal interference with existing mechanical harvesting processes.

---

### Why It Is Better Than the Status Quo

- Prevents SLFs from entering final collection bins  
- Recovers and preserves grape juice  
- Reduces waste disposal  
- Maintains harvest throughput  
- Modular and retrofittable  

---

## End-of-Semester Proof of Concept

A scaled prototype demonstrating:

- Continuous grape flow
- Effective SLF separation
- Functional filtration stages
- Juice recovery and recombination

---

## Key Risks / Unknowns

- **Harvester compatibility**  
  Regulatory and mechanical integration research required to ensure modular fit.

- **Filtration buildup or clogging**  
  System must match or exceed harvester throughput rates.

- **Grower adoption resistance**  
  Incorporate grower feedback and prioritize durability, repairability, and ease of use.

## Questions for the Client

1. Precisely when and where are grapes partially liquified during harvest?
2. Which harvester models are most commonly used in upstate NY?
3. How willing are growers to implement modular harvest technology?
4. Rank importance (1–5): efficiency, reliability, repairability, durability, ease of use.
