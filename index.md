## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I’m an engineering student at Cornell University with a passion for problem-solving, design, and performance optimization. As both a student and a track athlete, I’m constantly working to balance precision, discipline, and creativity—whether in the lab, on the track, or in the classroom.  

I’m especially interested in applying my skills to fields where engineering meets high performance, such as Formula One design and advanced mechanical systems. My long-term goal is to engineer solutions that push the limits of speed, efficiency, and innovation.  

Thanks for visiting!
